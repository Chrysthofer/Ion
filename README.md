## About & Resources

Welcome to the SAPHO - Scalable Architecture Processor for Hardware Optimization page! We are a team from the Signal Processing and Instrumentation Center at the UFJF Engineering School dedicated to the development of SAPHO, an open-source soft-core processor.

### Available Resources

- **Scalable Architecture:** SAPHO utilizes a scalable architecture that automatically allocates the necessary hardware resources during compilation.
- **Development Tools:** We offer a comprehensive IDE for SAPHO programming, along with C+- and Assembly compilers specifically developed for the processor.
- **Technical Documentation:** Explore user manuals, reference guides, and tutorials to help you understand and use SAPHO in your projects.

## Documentation & Updates

The complete documentation of SAPHO is available for on-line consultation. It includes detailed information about the processor architecture, the developed circuits, the necessary software tools for its operation, as well as tutorials and examples to assist in project development with SAPHO.

### Content

- **User Manuals:** A complete guide for programming and configuring SAPHO.
- **Compilation Guide:** Step-by-step instructions for compiling programs and generating Verilog code for the processor.
- **Release Notes:** Stay informed about the latest updates and enhancements implemented in SAPHO.
